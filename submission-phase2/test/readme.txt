Put your own tests here. 
Each test has a MiniRE script file(script.txt), a set of input files(input1.txt, input2.txt, ...), and ./run.sh.
./run.sh is a script that runs your program with the given MiniRE script and a set of input files.

Please name your script file as "script.txt"
Please name your input files as "input1.txt, input2.txt, ..."
Please name your output files as "output1.txt, output2.txt, ..."

Each test goes to an individual directory where directory names are like "test1, test2, ..."
You should include at least 3 test cases. (That is, you should have test1, test2, test3 directories at least)
At least one test case should contain a long MiniRE script with many operations.
