MiniRE
=====

This is a fully implemented interpreter for the MiniRE 'toy' language. You can think of MiniRE as a mini Awk or Perl. 

MiniRE deals primarily with the combination and manipulation of `string-lists`. 

It contains a built-from-scratch:
    -Regex engine (automata-based)
    -Scanner
    -Parser
    -Evaluator
